#### Manual Installation
- Go to your Steam installation directory: ```C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\wallpaper_engine\projects\myprojects\``` and copy all the file contents into a ```AudioScratchboardEnhanced``` folder.

OR

- In Wallpaper Engine click ```Open Wallpaper``` and choose ```Open offline wallpaper``` and select the ```index.html``` file. 
#
### üêõ Known Bugs üêõ
- Not all ```Default Shapes``` get randomly generated. So I tried rebuilding some of the shapes like the Circle and the Heart shape to make them functional enough. The ```Butterfly``` and ```Hemp``` are missing from the random generation.
- The ```Random Interval Seconds``` is not getting passed from the slider value on change. Simply change the wallpaper and back to update the value.
- The ```Random``` shape remains after changing to another shape. Simply change the wallpaper and back to update the value.
