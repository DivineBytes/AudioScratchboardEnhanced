## Installation:

OR

## Known Bugs:
- Not all ```Default Shapes``` get randomly generated. So I tried rebuilding some of the shapes like the Circle and the Heart shape to make them functional enough. The ```Butterfly``` and ```Hemp``` are missing from the random generation.
- The ```Random Interval Seconds``` is not getting passed from the slider value on change. Simply change the wallpaper and back to update the value.
- The ```Random``` shape remains after changing to another shape. Simply change the wallpaper and back to update the value.
